# Visibly push down automata learning 

This is a repository for the implementation of the experiments preformed in the paper:
"Extracting Context-Free Grammars from Recurrent Neural Networks using Tree-Automata Learning and A* Search"
If you are currently here and you see no other files we are sorry, the implementation will be added soon. 
Thank you for you patience.
